A shared task organized at ACL 2018 (Association for Computational Linguistics, Melbourne, Australia). The task aims to determining the word order and inflecting words from given unordered Universal Dependencies (UD) structures from which word order information has been removed and the tokens have been lemmatized.
Worked on techniques like Language Modelling and Neural Machine Translation methods to solve the problem of reinflection and correct word order generation.
