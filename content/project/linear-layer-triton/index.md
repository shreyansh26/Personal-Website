Implemented a high-performance linear layer (both forward and backward pass) with (optional) activation layer fusion using OpenAIâ€™s Triton.  
* The use of the custom Triton-based linear layer demonstrated up to 1.6x speedup in training FlanT5-Base on the Samsum dataset and up to 3.5x speedup in inference.  
* Automated the patching of PyTorch's nn.LinearLayer and associated activation layers to the new custom layers for inference using torch.fx for pattern matching and CUDA Graphs for reducing overheads.
