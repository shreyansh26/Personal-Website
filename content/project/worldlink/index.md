Created a social networking website (webapp) using the Django framework as a part of my curriculum
project.

Implemented features like user authentication, profile creation and edit options, posts/blogs creation,
like and comment on the posts, searching other users, personal messaging between users, following other
users and a meme generator for generating memes.
