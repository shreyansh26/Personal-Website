Work done as a part of the organizing team of RevOpiD, a shared task organized at IJCNLP 2017 (International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, Taipei, Taiwan).
The task aims to produce a top-k ranking of product reviews which can sufficiently represent the gist of opinions expressed in all the reviews of that product.
Implemented the official baseline for Subtask-B of the shared task. Also volunteered to annotate gold dataset for the shared task.
