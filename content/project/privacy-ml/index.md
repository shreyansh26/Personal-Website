Privacy Preserving Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification to detect chest pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

Uses TF-Encrypted to implement Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) and Differential Privacy. SMPC helps to provide secure predictions and Differential Privacy is used to enhance privacy.

The base model is a VGG16 model which is made secure and privacy-preserving.
